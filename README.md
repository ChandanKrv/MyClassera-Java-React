Design a home page which is visible to all user -design layout of home page on your own

Once user logs in, he should be redirected to dashboard.

There will be two user type -Admin and Student, few graph will be visible to user only.

No need for API calls, use these users 

If user name is invalid.user -it should give error, user need to be log, use a failure callback

If user name is student.user -few graphs are visible, use success callback with user specific view
